#writeBetter
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com). This was my individual project completed in just two days.

## Usage

writeBetter is a web service where the user can check the correct usage of a certain word. The user simply types in a word or phrase and automatically gets a page full of quotes with the given word or phrase from one or more reputable websites.

See [PRESS-RELEASE.md](PRESS-RELEASE.md) for the description of use cases.

## Possible feature extensions

- the websites can be categorized by context (news, sports, science, tech etc.)
- the websites can be ranked according to their reputation and reliability.
- the user can select the required context, which will limit the search only to relevant websites.
