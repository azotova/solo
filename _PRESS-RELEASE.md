There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
writeBetter

## Sub-Heading ##
Anyone who wants to write better and wonders how a particular word should be used can check the word usage on reputable websites.

## Summary ##
When people write important texts (business e-mails, articles, cover letters, even blog posts), sometimes they wonder how a certain word or phrase should be used, i.e. the meaning, the right usage context etc. Usually they google the word and then click a few links to check the word usage. This is time consuming. Also, there is a risk that the word is used incorrectly on the websites that come up first in Google search. writeBetter does this work for the user and shows a single page with relevant quotes from reputable websites.

## Problem ##
Sometimes, when writing important texts, people do not know how a certain word should be used. There are two solutions for this problem: 1) looking up the word in an (online) dictionary; 2) googling the word and checking how other authors use it. However, usage examples in dictionaries are often simplistic and artificial, and going through the results of google search is time-consuming. This problem is relevant both for native English speakers and foreigners.

## Solution ##
writeBetter is a web service where the user can check the correct usage of a certain word. The user simply types in a word or phrase and automatically gets a page full of quotes with the given word or phrase from several websites.

Optional: the websites can be categorized by context (news, sports, science, tech etc.)
Optional: the websites can be ranked according to their reputation and reliability.
Optional: the user can select the required context, which will limit the search only to relevant websites.
